Different types of Nexus repositories:



Proxy repository - Links to a remote repository. Maven, for example, has the Maven central repository. 
This is useful for grabbing jar files and/or other dependencies for Java applications.

Custom repository (create your own) - Not much needs to be said here. If you have an internal repo for your company
inside AWS, for example, then you could point to that URL for the Nexus config.

Hosted repository - Similar definition up above

Group repository - Useful if you have multiple individual repos you need to connect to. 
One group repo endpoint can be used in place of multiple individual ones.
